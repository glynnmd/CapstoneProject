**Matts Macros**     
Matthew Glynn 

**Project Overview**

Currently, the problem that lies within apps that help users keep track of macros, is the lack of user friendliness. Each app, does a good job highlighting certain aspects of what the app should include; however, not one has perfected every aspect of the app that will allow ease of use for the user. The goal of this project is to provide the user with the most ergonomic macros app possible. This app will (currently) include each of the following features:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to calculate recommended macros based on health goals (gain weight, lose weight, maintain weight).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to allow the use to insert specific values based on the meals they eat, that will calculate how many macros  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been consumed during the day and how many macros are left, based on their goal.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to save specific meals based on a given name and macro numbers.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to access those meals and insert those into their daily count, allowing the user to spend less time calculating  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; macros and making it easier for them to input their daily data.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	An option that shows the macros of specific foods. Instead of the user having to google how many carbs, fats and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proteins,for example, a banana has, they’ll be able to use the accessible options provided.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to recommend types of food to eat based on their diet.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to change the language of the app.   

If each of these features are implemented the correct way, it will allow any person who is on a mission to change their lifestyle, whether it is to gain weight, lose weight or maintain weight, the ease of keeping track of what they’re eating and how much they’re eating. Keeping track of every individual carbs, fats and proteins can be a lot of work; however, with each feature included in this app, each time the customer uses the app, the easier it gets for them to operate the app. Investors would find this very pleasing because customers would find the ease of use utilized with an attractive user interface a satisfying experience. 

**Similar Existing Work**

As of now, there are plenty of macro apps on the market. Just like this project, each app recommends macros, calculate macros, and stores daily macro count. Nevertheless, each app does not achieve the full potential of becoming the most convenient macros app. For example, just by simply looking at the apple store for macros app, the best apps can easily be found. Currently #7 in “Health & Fitness,” is the app “My Macros+.” With an overall review of 4.6/5 it seems like the perfect macros app; however, upon review, you can find multiple reviews that say the app is “frustrating” and “the food database is seriously lacking.” Supporting the fact that the macros app could be improved in order to provide ease of use to the customer.

**Previous Experience**

Experience that will assist in the completion of the project includes:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Java  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Debugging  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Software design  

**Technology**

Most, if not all, of the project will be completed in the integrated development environment called “Android Studio.” Android Studio has many features, including gradle-based build support, android specific refactoring, lint tools, deep code analysis, and a local testing environment. 

**Risk Areas** 

The biggest risk in the project is inexperience with Android Studio. Being that Android Studio is the program that is used in “Mobile Device Programming,” is the best option in designing an app, given the resources accessible. However, some learning will be required, which may increase risk depending on the complexity of the nuts and bolts of the app.
