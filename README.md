# CapstoneProject

Wednesday Feb 21 - Currently the project does a few things. It allows the user to insert macro goals and displays that information, displaying calories too. Along with that the user can insert specific meals that they eat, adjusting their goal value and displaying the remaining macros they have left. In addition, there is a button that leads to an activity labeled "saved meals". This activity allows clients to insert a meal name and its corresponding macros and adds it to a list that is displayed below there for future use. Currently the information that is inserted is deleted once the activitys are closed, the next goal in the project is to save that information and restore it once the activity is created again.
