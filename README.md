## Matts Macros
Macronutrients are the largest class of nutrients the body requires and is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
These three factors make up calories, per gram of protein and carbohydrates make up 4 calories and per gram of fat makes 
up 9 calories. The amounts and ratio of macronutrients a person need vary depending on age, gender, lifestyle and health 
goals. It is a lot easier for an individual to achieve goals by keeping track of their macros rather than calories as a
whole. The	goal	of	this	project	is	to	provide	the	user	with	the	most	ergonomic	macros	app	possible, that will help
them achieve realistic goals and keep track of those goals.
