# Matts Macros

## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Macronutrients are the largest class of nutrients the body requires and is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
These three factors make up calories, per gram of protein and carbohydrates make up 4 calories and per gram of fat makes 
up 9 calories. The amounts and ratio of macronutrients a person need vary depending on age, gender, lifestyle and health 
goals. It is a lot easier for an individual to achieve goals by keeping track of their macros rather than calories as a
whole. The	goal	of	this	project	is	to	provide	the	user	with	the	most	ergonomic	macros	app	possible, that will help
them achieve realistic goals and keep track of those goals.

## User Instructions
#### How to try your project/run your own copy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the only way to run the project requires you to download my entire repository and import directly into Android Studio. Which provides a simple way of achieving that, simply open Android Studio, select File > New > Import Project and then select Gradle build java. Once it is set up, you may install and run a digital version of an Android device or you may plug in an Android device directly. However, with the Android device you must access the settings, find the build number, tap seven times and activate developer settings, which will allow you to install the app on your device. 

#### How to work the app

## Developer Instructions
#### How to set up a development environment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of now, simply download the repository and import directly into Android Studio. This will allow you to set up the development environment. 
#### How to run your tests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were no automated test, all test were done manually. Feel free to install the app, use it anyway you'd like and report any bugs to the issue tab. 
#### How to contribute (if your project is actually public)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to contribute is to fork the project and begin making adjustments as you please. Then provide feedback to me anyway possible and I will consider the updates.
