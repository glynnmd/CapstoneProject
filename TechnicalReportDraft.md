### Abstract
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the problem that lies within apps that help users keep track of macros, is the lack of user friendliness. Each app, does a good job highlighting certain aspects of what the app should include; however, not one has perfected every aspect of the app that will allow ease of use for the user. The goal of this project is to provide the user with the most ergonomic macros app possible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are macronutrients, otherwise known as macros? Macronutrients are the largest class of nutrients the body requires and is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. These three factors make up calories, per gram of protein and carbohydrates make up 4 calories and per gram of fat makes up 9 calories. The amounts and ratio of macronutrients a person need vary depending on age, gender, lifestyle and health goals. It is a lot easier for an individual to achieve goals by keeping track of their macros rather than calories as a whole. For example, if an individual counted calories they could say they ate 200 calories, but that doesnt help reach their goal, considering that 200 calories could consist of 20 grams of fat, 2 grams of carbs and 2 grams of proteins or 20 grams of proteins, 20 grams of carbs, and 5 grams of fat. Both results have completely different outcomes.
