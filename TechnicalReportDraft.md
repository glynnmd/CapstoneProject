**Abstract**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the problem that lies within apps that help users keep track of macros, is the lack of user friendliness. Each app, does a good job highlighting certain aspects of what the app should include; however, not one has perfected every aspect of the app that will allow ease of use for the user. The goal of this project is to provide the user with the most ergonomic macros app possible.

### Introduction and Product Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are macronutrients, otherwise known as macros? Macronutrients are the largest class of nutrients the body requires and is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. These three factors make up calories, per gram of protein and carbohydrates make up 4 calories and per gram of fat makes up 9 calories. The amounts and ratio of macronutrients a person need vary depending on age, gender, lifestyle and health goals. It is a lot easier for an individual to achieve goals by keeping track of their macros rather than calories as a whole. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there are plenty of apps on the market that assist individuals in keeping track of their macros. However, it's rare to find a macros app that highlights every feature to be user friendly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to calculate recommended macros based on health goals (gain weight, lose weight, maintain weight).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to allow the use to insert specific values based on the meals they eat, that will calculate how many macros  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been consumed during the day and how many macros are left, based on their goal.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to save specific meals based on a given name and macro numbers.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	Ability to access those meals and insert those into their daily count, allowing the user to spend less time calculating  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; macros and making it easier for them to input their daily data.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	An option that shows the macros of specific foods. Instead of the user having to google how many carbs, fats and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proteins,for example, a banana has, they’ll be able to use the accessible options provided.
